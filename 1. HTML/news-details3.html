	<h3>According to Washington Post, R&AW official Vikram Yadav directed businessman Nikhil Gupta, now in custody in the Czech Republic, to hire a hitman to kill Pannun outside his New York residence; it says NSA Ajit Doval was ‘probably aware of RAW’s plans to kill Sikh activists’.</h3>

	<p>U.S. authorities believe the alleged plot to kill Khalistani activist, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, who is wanted on terror charges in India, was ordered by the previous chief of the Indian Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW), and had official sanction from senior intelligence officials with “with ties to [Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s inner circle”, the Washington Post a U.S.-national daily reported.</p>
	<p>The report in the Washington Post newspaper identified, for the first time, an R&AW officer whose name had been withheld in the case papers made available by the Justice Department in New York in November 2023. In a separate press release, the Post said, on the basis of interviews with “more than three dozen current and former senior officials in the United States, India, Canada, Britain, Germany and Australia”, that other R&AW officers have faced “arrest, expulsion and reprimand” in recent months, indicating that there was more international coordination about what it called “escalating campaign of aggression” against Indian diaspora members by India’s intelligence operatives.
